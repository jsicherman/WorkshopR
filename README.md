# WorkshopR

This repo contains files for the DMCBH's weekly R workshops. All code and content here, unless otherwise noted, is written by Jordan Sicherman. That being said, I draw from a number of amazing sources that deserve credit. Namely the UBC Masters of Data Science course, DSCI 523 (written in large part by Tiffany Timbers), Hadley Wickham's "Advanced R" book ([here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)), Kelsey Moty's NYU CDSC Lab ([here](https://nyu-cdsc.github.io/learningr/)).

New workshops will be posted approximately weekly which aim to help students with absolutely no experience with R learn a variety of useful techniques, enabling them to perform their entire analysis independently and efficiently.

Content will change depending on the interests of the group. Eventually I'll try to make these worksheets more beautiful so that this repository can help a wider audience.
